						<h2 class="title">Horton Plains National Park </h2>
						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="images/img3.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="" class="alignleft border" />Horton Plains is a beautiful, stark world with excellent hikes in the shadows of Sri Lanka’s second- and third-highest mountains, Kirigalpotta (2395m) and Totapola (2357m). The ‘plains’ form an undulating plateau over 2000m high, covered by wild grasslands and interspersed with patches of thick forest, rocky outcrops, filigree waterfalls and misty lakes. The surprising diversity of the landscape is matched by the wide variety of wildlife, although many of the larger animals are very elusive. Birdwatchers will be well rewarded.</p>

						<h2 class="title">Adam's Peak (Sri Pada)</h2>
						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="images/im4.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="" class="alignleft border" />Located in a beautiful area of the southern Hill Country, this lofty peak has sparked the imagination for centuries and been a focus for pilgrimage for more than 1000 years.
							It's variously known as Adam’s Peak (the place where Adam first set foot on earth after being cast out of heaven), Sri Pada (Sacred Footprint, left by the Buddha as he headed towards paradise), or perhaps most poetically as Samanalakande (Butterfly Mountain; where butterflies go to die). Legends attribute the huge ‘footprint’ crowning the peak to St Thomas, the early apostle of India, or even Lord Shiva.

							The pilgrimage season begins on poya day in December and runs until the Vesak festival in May. In season, pilgrims and tourists alike make the climb up the countless steps to the top. At other times, the summit's temple can be unused, and is often obscured by clouds.</p>

						<h2 class="title">Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic </h2>
						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="images/img5.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="" class="alignleft border" />The golden-roofed Temple of the Sacred Tooth houses Sri Lanka’s most important Buddhist relic – a tooth of the Buddha. During puja (offerings or prayers), the heavily guarded room housing the tooth is open to devotees and tourists. However, you don’t actually see the tooth. It’s kept in a gold casket shaped like a dagoba (stupa), which contains a series of six dagoba caskets of diminishing size.As well as the revered main temple, the complex includes a series of smaller temples, shrines and museums.Freelance guides will offer their services around the entire temple complex for around Rs 600, and free audio guides are available at the ticket office. An elevator facilitates access for travellers with disabilities.
						The complex can get crowded as it receives many worshippers and tourists, and backpackers, Chinese tour groups and Thai monks all jostle for space. Wear clothes that cover your legs and your shoulders, and remove your shoes.</p>

						<h2 class="title">NuwaraEliya </h2>
						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="images/img6.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="" class="alignleft border" />Often referred to as ‘Little England’, this genteel highland community does have a rose-tinted, vaguely British-country-village feel to it, with its colonial-era bungalows, Tudor-style hotels, well-tended hedgerows and pretty gardens. Indeed, Nuwara Eliya was once was the favoured cool-climate escape for the hard-working and hard-drinking English and Scottish pioneers of Sri Lanka’s tea industry.
							A recent construction boom has blighted the scene to a degree, and the dusty and bustling centre is a thoroughly Sri Lankan urban tangle, but Nuwara Eliya still makes a fine base for a few days' relaxation. The verdant surrounding countryside of tea plantations, carefully tended vegetable plots and craggy hills is highly scenic. Treat yourself to a night in one of Nuwara Eliya’s colonial hotels, play a round of golf or a few frames of billiards, and soak up the town’s unique bygone heritage.

						<h2 class="title">Peradeniya Botanic Gardens</h2>
						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="images/img7.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="" class="alignleft border" />These stunning gardens were once reserved exclusively for Kandyan royalty. Today, even commoners are allowed in to enjoy the most impressive and largest (60 hectares) botanic gardens in Sri Lanka.

							Highlights include a fine collection of orchids, a stately avenue of royal palms, the extraordinary, aptly named cannonball fruit tree and 40m-high Burma bamboo. Another big hit is the giant Javan fig tree on the great lawn, with its colossal central trunk and umbrella-like canopy of branches. Peradeniya is 6km from central Kandy.</p>

						<h2 class="title">Walking in Ella </h2>
						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="images/img8.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="" class="alignleft border" />The Little Adam’s Peak Although this climb is relatively easy, the views from the top of Little Adam’s Peak are sensational. Begin the climb with a gentle stroll through a sloping tea field, passing endless neat rows of terraced tea plants, before ascending a short stretch of winding steps up to the top of the peak. From the top, there is a spectacular panorama featuring Ella Rock, rolling tea fields and the Ella gap, a deep gorge that leads all the way down to the southern valleys. On a clear day, you can see all the way to the south coast with the ocean glimmering on the horizon.<br> 

                            Ella Rock Hiking up Ella Rock is one of the most popular treks to do in Ella, but is also far more strenuous than the relatively easy climb up Little Adam’s Peak. The summit is 3,300m above sea level, and 1,000m higher than Ella town, and the views from the top are astonishing. The entire trek takes about 4-5 hours. Walk along the railway lines for about half an hour, accompanied by the local monkeys swinging through the trees, and then begin the ascent up the slope through fields of chilli, tomato, lemon grass and avocado, and look out for eucalyptus, banana and jack fruit trees. You also pass a large tea plantation and fascinating tropical plants like the Venus fly trap.<br>

							Nine Arch Bridge Located in Ella, the Nine Arch Bridge is one of the most iconic bridges in Sri Lanka and is a stunning example of the incredible engineering prowess behind the island’s railway system. First constructed in the 19th century during the British colonial period, Sri Lanka’s railway line remains the easiest and most picturesque way to access the hill country. Built in 1921, the Nine Arch Bridge is a 30-metre-high viaduct with dramatic, high arches, a beautiful piece of architecture which stands in testament to the exceptional engineering skills of the British.</h2>

						<h2 class="title">Lipton's Seat </h2>
						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="images/img9.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="" class="alignleft border" />The Scottish tea baron Sir Thomas Lipton used to survey his burgeoning empire from here. Lipton’s seat is a panoramic overlooking destination in Sri lanka. Handapanagala lake, Chandrika lake, Uda walwe lake, Wedi hiti Kanda mountains, and also the hambanthota harbor alocated in the in the southern coastal area nd five provinces in Sri Lanka can be seen remarkably. The Dambetenna longest tea factor</p>

						<h2 class="title">Hike in the Knuckles</h2>
						<div class="entry">
							<p><img src="images/img10.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="" class="alignleft border" />The Knuckles Mountain Range, so named because of its resemblance to the knuckles of a clenched fist, is wonderful walking country.
							The best walking months are mid-February to April and June to August and Red Dot offers the choice of a half day (8 kms) or full day (18 kms) trek. 
							This rugged 235 sq kilometre range is made up of mountain peaks, cascading waterfalls, simple villages nestled into the slopes, terraced rice fields and a sense of discovering nature at its most enchanting. 
							Whatever your hiking experience, it remains compulsory for you to have a guide in this protected reserve, a UNESCO world heritage site, and apart from the danger of losing your way failure to do so could bring problems with the authorities. Our trekker, an outdoors enthusiast and naturalist, will point out interesting aspects of the walk or just allow you to become lost in your own thoughts – whatever you tell him you prefer. 
							As Sri Lanka's popularity grows, here remains a mystical region, still off-the-beaten track, with breathtaking views and a sense of remoteness that will appeal to experienced and novice hikers alike.</p>
